## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Your API Key

The chatbot requires a Claude API key from Anthropic:

1. Get an API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   ```
3. Open `config.js` in a text editor
4. Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: 'sk-ant-api03-...'
   ```

**⚠️ Security Note:**
- `config.js` is in `.gitignore` and will NOT be committed to the repository
- This prevents accidentally exposing your API key in version control
- For production use, consider setting up a backend service to handle API calls instead of exposing your API key in the frontend

### 2. Add Your Regulation Documents

To add your Massachusetts school age program regulation documents:

1. Open `documents.js` in a text editor
2. Find the `documents` array (around line 8)
3. Replace the sample document with your actual regulation documents:

```javascript
documents: [
    {
        id: 'ma-606-regulations',
        name: '606 CMR 7.00: Standards for School Age Child Care Programs',
        description: 'Massachusetts regulations for school age child care programs',
        content: `PASTE FULL TEXT OF THE REGULATION DOCUMENT HERE

        Include all sections, subsections, and complete text.
        The AI will use this to answer questions and provide citations.`
    },
    {
        id: 'another-document',
        name: 'Another Regulation Document',
        description: 'Brief description',
        content: `Full text of another document...`
    }
    // Add more documents as needed
]
```

**Tips for adding documents:**
- Include the complete text of each regulation
- Keep formatting simple (plain text works best)
- Include section numbers and headers for better citations
- You can add multiple documents to the array
- The AI will search across all documents to answer questions

### 3. Customize Sample Questions (Optional)

You can customize the sample questions that appear in the sidebar:

1. Open `documents.js`
2. Find the `sampleQuestions` array
3. Add, remove, or modify questions to match your documents:

```javascript
sampleQuestions: [
    "What are the staff-to-child ratio requirements?",
    "What qualifications must directors have?",
    "Your custom question here?",
    // Add more questions...
]
```

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Your site is already set up for GitHub Pages:

1. Push your changes to the repository
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Set source to the main branch
4. Your site will be available at https://MAPASOST.github.io

2. **Sample Questions**: Rotates 5 random questions every 10 seconds to inspire users
3. **Document Loading**: All regulation documents are loaded into the AI's context

## Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `styles.css` and modify the CSS variables in the `:root` section:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2c5aa0;      /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #1e3a5f;    /* Darker accent */
    --accent-color: #4a90e2;       /* Interactive elements */
    /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

### Adjusting Sample Question Rotation Time

Edit `config.js` and change the rotation interval (in milliseconds):

```javascript
SAMPLE_QUESTION_ROTATION_INTERVAL: 10000, // 10 seconds (10000 ms)
```

### Modifying AI Behavior

Edit the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `config.js` to change how the AI responds:

```javascript
SYSTEM_PROMPT: `Your custom instructions here...`
```

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Not Configured" Error

### AI Not Providing Accurate Answers
- Ensure your documents are fully pasted into `documents.js`

### Sample Questions Not Rotating
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure `documents.js` is properly loaded
- Verify the rotation interval setting in `config.js`
