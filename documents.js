7.01: Introduction
In 2005 the Massachusetts General Court created the Department of Early Education and
Care (EEC), which became operational July 1, 2005. Responsible to an independent Board of
Early Education and Care, EEC combines the functions of the former Office of Child Care
Services (OCCS) and the former Early Learning Services Unit at the Department of Education.
EEC is responsible for the licensing of early education and care programs and for providing
financial assistance for child care services to low-income families, information and referral
services, parenting support for all families, and professional development opportunities for staff
in the early education and care field. The mission of the Massachusetts Department of Early
Education and Care is to provide the foundation that supports all children in their development
as lifelong learners and contributing members of the community, and to support families in their
essential work as parents and caregivers. In fulfilling this mission, EEC has developed specific
regulations to be met by all providers of early care and education services in the Commonwealth,
whether home, school or center-based.

In developing these standards EEC has sought to build on the strengths of the existing
systems of licensing and program quality, put children and families first, and be flexible and
accountable. Further, EEC has sought to establish standards that support high quality early
education and care programs that reflect the diversity of the Commonwealth; strengthen families;
and help children learn and grow physically, socially, emotionally, and educationally.

Unless specifically noted in 606 CMR 7.00, all requirements in 606 CMR 7.00 apply to all
programs providing non-residential services to children younger than 14 years old outside their
own homes, regardless of the care setting or the age of the children served.

7.02: Definitions
As used in 606 CMR 7.00, the following words shall have the following meaning unless the
context otherwise requires:

Applicant - The individual who has been designated as the person responsible for the
administration of the program or facility and is the duly authorized agent of the person applying
for licensure or approval.

Approved Activity Space - The indoor and outdoor areas determined by the Department to be
safe and appropriate for children in an early education and care program. This space shall
include only usable floor space exclusive of hallways, bathrooms, and portions of rooms or areas
that contain furniture or equipment suitable only for adult use.

School Age Child - A kindergarten child, or a child who is attending a public or approved private elementary school.
